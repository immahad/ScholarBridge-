# ScholarBridge-
ScholarBridge is a full-stack web application developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The system aims to automate the scholarship lifecycle by providing dedicated dashboards for students, donors, and admins. Students can apply for scholarships, donors can fund applicants, and admins can manage the entire workflow.
